Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

My understanding of the experiment that the team is replicating is that they are looking at the effect of taxation on the population. In order to make the model more realistic, the team goes on to examine only splitting the welfare among agents who had less than the mean amount of sugar. These questions provide information about tax system and how it can benefit or harm people around them. The team's explanation is quite clear on their question, though could benefit in explaining a little more clearly if the wealth was redistributed out evenly.

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The methodology made sense for the question. The one thing I would add, which is what I said previously, is to really adress if it is being redistributed out evenly to the population. After reading the paper I realize now that it was distributed evenly out, because the extension is an implementation of it being redistributed unevenly. It would be awesome to include a little bit more about the starting positions of the agents. Are they randomly spread across a range of wealth, or are there a set among for each economic class?

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I understand the results quite clearly, though there is some fudging of the data that seemed to be a little unclear, but since it is a replication of a paper with unknown methodology it does make sense. Viualizations are effective, though 4a, it is confusing why you did not show population tax as well and explain it in the same section.

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

I think the argument does hold water, but then again the argument is a little unclear. I would be really clear about what you want to say about these results. Are you telling us that taxing is effective in terms of keeping a population healthy and sustainable? Or that this specific taxing bracket is effective? This seems to be something known and clear about the system, but what is this specific implementation telling us about taxation.

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the 

The results in the report seem to be consistent with the paper! Obviously, there are some things that were fudged but the overall trends seemed to be accurate.

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

The report does explain a good extension to the original experiment clearly, though they could explain a little further on what they learned from their extension.


Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

They are very good and are more than on schedule.

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

The report was clearly written, but I noticed some past tense throughout the writing.

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Everything looks good to me!
