- abstract is written in past tense

- add more description of what a sugarscape model is, it is still a bit unclear

- add picture of sugarscapes to make things clearer (at t=0,100,500, etc)?

- methodology is clear and well explained

- reasoning section very short. Present alternative hypothesis?

- progress seems very good.

- layout seems correct, maybe resize some of the graphs (2a, 3a, others)

- Do you only ave one paper to cite? No other things (like original sugarscape model paper)?

- What happens to fitnss wit taxation? Lower average vision? ow much sugar gets harvested total?

- Justify decision to remove 15% of taxed sugar? what are results if more or less is lost?
