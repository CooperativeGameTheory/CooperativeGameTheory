# Modeling cooperation in the spatial PD with noise and biased migration
*Noah Rivkin, Katya Donovan, Tony Kim*

Following Helbing’s and Yu’s *The outbreak of cooperation among success-driven individuals under noisy conditions*, we will investigate the self-organization of cooperative behavior. By modeling unrelated individuals with no behavioral traits and no social networks who are success-driven, we examine when and why cooperation occurs, even when the model makes cooperation difficult.

We will simulate Prisoner’s Dilemma game on two dimensional spatial environment with 2 kinds of noises. First, we will add strategy mutation noise. With probability r, each individual will spontaneously choose to cooperate with probability q or to defect with probability 1-q until the next strategy change. Second, we will add random relocation noise. With probability r, an individual randomly chooses a free site without expected success. We will do all 4 combinations of experiments whether to add each of the noises.

To extend our experiments, we are hoping to add some of the following : biased relocation, various types of agents, social networks, and population pressure. Rather than randomly choosing a free site, we want the agent to choose a location where the likelihood of success is higher. Also, we want to introduces different types of agents and see how they interact. In addition, we are hoping to add social network to the experiments. Lastly, we want to see how agents behave given the population pressure. For example, resource or age restriction. 

We expect to see the migration of our agents across the grid, forming clusters that are cooperative after several time steps. A possible graph of our experiment follows.
